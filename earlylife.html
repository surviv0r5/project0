         <p>It is vital that these relationships are positive and that your children’s everyday experiences are meaningful, as it is these things that help shape the people they will grow to become.
            Daily opportunities to play, laugh and learn are vitally important – they allow your children to practise skills, communicate with others, take on challenges and solve problems in fun and enjoyable ways.
            These, along with good health and nutrition, are extremely important in making sure your children get the best start in life.</p>

          <h1>School Days</h1>
          <p>I participated in many extracurricular activities too like ‘best out of waste’ science model contest, powerpoint presentations competition (ppt), Hindi essay writing competition, etc.(Even won some!) In sports the game I played was TT, Badminton and sometimes cricket. I and my friends were a part of MATH Club of my school and represented it in Kaizan carnival.</p>

          <h1>College Days</h1>
         
         
           <p>The college schedule is very different than the traditional high school schedule. Typically, there is a lot more flexibility with your college classes. In high school, you were probably told that you had to take US History, which was offered every day at 10:00 am. In college, you’ll probably need to take a history class, but you could have 10 choices, which would be offered on different days, at different times, and for different durations.</p>
